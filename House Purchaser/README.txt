This program uses a Windows(tm) powershell script to automatically click "Confirm" (.) and "Move Cursor/Target Cursor Left" (,) to try to buy plots.
To set this up go into Keybind > System, change "Confirm" (top option) to "." and "Move Cursor/Target Cursor Left" (8th from top) to ",".


DISCLAIMER:
EXTERNAL SCRIPTS CAN GET YOUR ACCOUNT TERMINATED. UNDERSTAND THE RISKS OF USING SUCH A PROGRAM, I ACCEPT NO FAULT FOR ANY CONSIQUENCES AS A RESULT OF USING THE POWERSHELL SCRIPT.
